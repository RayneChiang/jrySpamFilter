# jrySpamFilter

My design mainly uses the naive Bayes algorithm in the deep learning algorithm to classify and filter the mail. In machine learning, a naive Bayes classifier is a "probabilistic classifier", based on Bayes' theorem, and has a strong (naive) independence assumption between features. The algorithm is relatively simple and is often used for text classification.
Meanwhile,my design is based on a data sources of 8000 spams and 8000 normal emails to train the ML model. And I use python to Implement Bayesian algorithm on my spam filter. Besides,three evaluation criteria (classification accuracy, F1-Measure, AUC-ROC) were used to make a relatively complete and objective evaluation of the learning model. The classification accuracy of the spam filter is 95.6%, the classification error rate is 4.4%, the FPR false positive rate is 5.35%, and the FNR false negative rate is 3.4%; the F-Score value is 0.9564; the AUC value is 0.9824 In the interval [0.95 ~ 1].After these three evaluation methods, it is concluded that the spam filter model performs well and has high authenticity and reliability.
